# CF Image proxy

A modernized, simple image proxy and CDN utilizing Cloudflare Workers.

Based on a fork of [cf-image-proxy](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/cf-image-proxy)

Modernized with:

- ðŸŽ¨ **Biome** - Modern linting and formatting
- ðŸ“˜ **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- âš¡ **ES2022** - Latest JavaScript features
- ðŸ§ª **Vitest** - Fast unit testing
- ðŸ”§ **Miniflare** - Local development server
- ðŸ“¦ **ESM** - Native ES modules

> Image proxy and CDN for [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com).

## Features

- Free ðŸ’ª
- Super simple to setup and self-host
- Perfect lighthouse scores
- Handles CORS for you
- Normalizes origin URLs
- Respects `pragma: no-cache` and related headers
- Used in hundreds of prod sites

## Quick Setup

1. Fork or clone this repo
2. `cp wrangler.example.toml wrangler.toml`
3. `npx wrangler login` to authenticate with your Cloudflare account
4. `npx wrangler whoami` to get your `account_id`
5. Update the missing values in [wrangler.toml](./wrangler.toml)
6. `npm i`
7. `npm run deploy` to deploy to Cloudflare Workers ðŸ’ª

### wrangler.toml

```toml
name = "cf-image-proxy"
main = "src/index.js"
account_id = "YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID"
workers_dev = true
compatibility_date = "2025-10-30"

[[routes]]
pattern = "YOUR_DOMAIN" # e.g. img.example.com
custom_domain = true # auto creates Cloudflare DNS records for you
```

### Cloudflare Polish

You can optionally enable Polish in your Cloudflare zone settings if you want to enable on-the-fly image optimization as part of your CDN. In many cases, this will serve images to supported clients in an optimized `webp` format.

This may increase costs, so it's not recommended for everyone. The CF worker should support both configurations without issue.

### CDN

By default, all assets will be served with a `cache-control` header set to `public, immutable, s-maxage=31536000, max-age=31536000, stale-while-revalidate=60`, which effectively makes them cached at all levels indefinitely (or more practically until Cloudflare or your browser purges the asset from its cache).

If you want to change this `cache-control` header or add additional headers, see [src/fetch-request.js](./src/fetch-request.js).

## Development

The project uses [Biome](https://biomejs.dev) for linting and formatting. Available commands:

- `npm run dev` - Start a local dev server with Wrangler (Miniflare)
- `npm test` - Run tests with Vitest
- `npm run lint` - Check for linting issues
- `npm run preview` - Preview the worker in the Cloudflare edge runtime
- `npm run deploy` - Builds and deploy the worker to Cloudflare
- `npm run build` - Perform a dry-run build of the worker
- `npm run format` - Format all files
- `npm run lint` - Check for linting issues
- `npm run typecheck` - Run TypeScript type checking

## Usage

### General Usage

In the application where you want to consume your proxied images, you'll need to replace your third-party image URLs.

You can replace them with your proxy domain plus a path that contains the URI-encoded version of your original domain. In TypeScript, this looks like the following:

```ts
const imageCDNHost = 'https://exampledomain.com'

export const mapImageUrl = (imageUrl: string) => {
  if (imageUrl.startsWith('data:')) {
    return imageUrl
  }

  if (imageCDNHost) {
    // Our proxy uses Cloudflare's global CDN to cache these image assets
    return `${imageCDNHost}/${encodeURIComponent(imageUrl)}`
  } else {
    return imageUrl
  }
}
```

## Technical Notes

A few notes about the implementation:

- It is hosted via Cloudflare (CF) edge [workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com).
- CF runs our worker via V8 directly in an environment mimicking [web workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API).
- It does have access to a custom [web fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).

## TODO

- [ ] Support restricting the origin domain in order to prevent abuse
- [ ] Add a snazzy demo
